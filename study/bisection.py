Binary search in python
bisect module

This module provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list after each insertion.

As the name says, it uses bisection algorithm.

bisect.bisect_left
-> locate the insertion point for x in a to maintain sorted order., say ip is the insertion point

partitions the array into two parts
arr[:ip] -> In this half, all the elements are less than x
arr[ip:] -> In this half, all the elements are greater than or equal to x

bisect.bisect_right, bisect
-> locates the insertion point for x such that insertion point, ip comes after the existing entries of x
partitions the array into two parts
arr[:ip] -> In this half, all the elements are less than or equal to x
arr[ip:] -> In this half, all the elements are greater than x

bisect.insort_left
inserts x in a sorted order, first performs bisect_left to get the insertion point and then performs list.insert(ip)
so, it is 0(n)

so 0(lgn) search is dominated by 0(n) insertion 

bisect.insort_right, bisect.insort
inserts x in a sorted order, first performs bisect_right to get the insertion point and then performs list.insert(ip)

so 0(lgn) search is dominated by 0(n) insertion
