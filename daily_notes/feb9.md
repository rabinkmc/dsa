## Liberal education is very important

You cannot think independently unless you have your own worldview far removed
from the biases as far as possible. For, this you have to understand history,
reasoning, philosophy, law, religion and its psychology and great fictions.

I now have no qualms in saying I want to be virtuous man. A virtuos man has
moral sensibility and is bound to his duty, duty to his craft or duty to the
people around him. So, if I am not in a position where I can acquire those
experiences, at least I can pretend to imitate those experiences and I think
this is where books come in.

So, I have two clear distinctions:

1. Keep improving at your craft. If you can build something, build it. If you
   can't, try to learn what others have built and how they went about things.
Same as in reading, learn by imitating those experiences of great programmers.
2. Read books on wide variety of subjects.

So, my initial plan for now is of the allocated 12 hours for my improvement, 7-8
hours will be designated to my craft and the remaining 4-5 hours will be
dedicated to reading those books.

Currently, I am reading fiction primarily. Now, I have to add other books to my
collection and as far as possible try to devise my own self curriculum. I think
I have had enough experiences in life and mental maturity that I can read about
these subjects in much greater depth. And, this is the best possible time to
pursue that goal. This couldn't have happened earlier and probably would be
unwise to put this task to later years when I already have the realization.

## problem 1 

Before diving into CS, I have to convince myself that being better at craft is
absolutely important. Currently, I am riding on a high of self improvement and I
have this feeling that programming is just a side gig. No, it's isn't. Just like
reading liberal books isn't a side gig. They are at the same priority. You can
be all wise and great but what is the point of education if all you do is just
read and close yourself of outside world. Programming is the contact to my
outside world. This is probably where I can make the greatest impact and in its
perservance I will understand about hard work and commitment to my goal. So,
give your absolutely 100% when you are working on programming. In that 7-8
hours, there is nothing greater than fully investing in it. And, after 3-4
months, I will have to venture into this outside world and boy! oh boy!, you
will be pour everything to that goal, every iota of energy you can squeeze out
of yourself.
