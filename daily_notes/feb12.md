## problem 1: remove nth node from the end of the list

just stored the nodes on the list and kept track of indices
handle the case for head node. With dummy pointer I think it is actually easier.

## problem 2: logger rate limiter

keep track of the messages, if the message arrives earlier than the set time,
ignore, else update the next timestamp 

## problem 3: randomized set

## problem 4: design search autocomplete system

trie, just trie, and make sure to add sentence itself for the sentence inserted
in the node iteself.
