# High Level 2024 Goals 
- Have a stable job ( around 2-4 lakhs per month) and keep working on getting better job.
- Get in good shape, weigh 55-60kg, strength goal(deadlift - 140kg, bench - 70 kg, squat -> 120 kg) 
- Keep doing low level programming, operating system, database, unix tools and can they be improved.
- create some open source project, try contributing in some projects. ( work on unix tools)


## First month goal ( Jan 2024)
First 1 month, solve 500 leetcode problems (at least 400 medium problems), leetcode

It's a wild goal, but that is what it will take to improve my life drastically. But I truly believe
that is achievable, that is like 17 problems a day. ( And if you at least work for 12 hours)
sleep ( 6 hr), workout (1 hour + 30 min prep), (2 hrs misc - eating, rest ) 

I will dedicate each day to training and practice. Training is a study phase, and practice is where I will 
gather information to work on what I need to train.

### Study phase -  (7:30 - 3:00pm)
   
#### 7:30am - 10:30 am 
  - first 3 hours have to be intense, aim around 10 problems (we are solving problems of the same category)
    0. Just solve it on paper, if you cannot don't bother implementing it (time box it with 10mins).
    1. If you can solve it implement it (5 min), after 15 mins, regardless of if you solved it or not
    2. look into the solutions - take a hard look at the solutions, don't drop off the energy, invest in it, 
       try understanding it. If you have to write down the problem in paper, write it down, and now implement
       the solution without looking at it. 
    3. Even after looking at the solution, you cannot implement it, you 
       probably lack the basics on that particular topic ( now it's been 30 mins). 
    4. Even after 30 mins, you haven't solved the particular problem, maybe there's simpler problem on that
       topic, solve those problems first and do the step 0 -3 for the simpler problem again.
  - At the end of 3 hours, evaluate your state, if you have solved around 10 problems ( i.e,  it took you 
    30 minutes to solve problem, you're in a good state.) If you solved less than 5 problems, maybe you lack 
    understanding on some topics, identify those, take note of them to study for later.

    > **20-30 mins break** 
      Break are just time for reflection - don't go youtube, or book or email or anything, just your thoughts

#### 11:00 - 1:00 am
  - next 2 hours
    0. Look at your improvement notes.
    1. Take the most fundamental topic that is on top.
    2. Study hard on those topics, again refrain from coding, first solve it on paper. 
    3. And always, make sure your code works and you know how to implement it. If it takes you longer to implement
       the solution ( more than 5 minutes), you have to again go back and reevaluate if you absorbed the topic well.
       And again, maybe you have to look at the topic and see if you have all the knowledge of the fundamentals that
       you need for the topic. If you need, again take note of that fundamental topics.

    > **20-30 mins break** 
      Break are just time for reflection - don't go youtube, or book or email or anything, just your thoughts


#### 1:30 - 2:30 am
  - next 1 hour 
    0. Try to explain the topic you are working on with and try to explain it to yourself. Keep a score of how well
        you were to explain it to yourself.

    > **20-30 mins break**  
      Break are just time for reflection - don't go youtube, or book or email or anything, just your thoughts

    -- You are at the end of ( 8th hour (assuming 2 hour buffer) )

### Practice
  - Idea is to work on random problems to gather information on where you are weak. And study those topics on training
    phase.

#### 3:00 - 4:30pm ( 1st virtual contest ) 
  - first hour - leave the hard problem aside
  - next 30 minutes - forensic, analyse the problem, what was the problem based on, take note of that and solve them.
  
#### 5:00 - 6:30pm ( 2nd virtual contest )
  0. first hour - leave the hard problem aside
  1. next 30 minutes - forensic, analyse the problem, what was the problem based on, take note of that and solve them.

#### 7:00 - 8:30pm ( 3nd virtual contest )
  0. first hour - leave the hard problem aside
  1. next 30 minutes - forensic, analyse the problem, what was the problem based on, take note of that and solve them.

    > **20-30 mins break**

#### 9:00 - 9:30 pm
  0. Leetcode daily challenge

#### 9:30 - 11:00 pm
  - do what you want, maybe you want to solve leetcode problems more, (if you want, do easy problems)
  - work on you vim config, editing skill and learn more, or maybe just listen to music, or watch movie(not advised)

## 11:00 - 5:30 am( sleep )
  - Good sleep is very important to build those neural networks.
