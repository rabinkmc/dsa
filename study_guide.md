**The routine may change but what I should aim for is to track everything I do, so that I can review later on and improve.**

### Contest Phase (1 - 2hr : 1hr problem + 1hr analysis)
- first hour - leave the hard problem aside
- next 30 minutes - forensic, analyse the problem, what was the problem based on, take note of that and solve them.

    > **20-30 mins break** 
      Break are just time for reflection - don't go youtube, or book or email or anything, just your thoughts

## Study Phase ( 3 hr ( 1hr stuy + 2hr dedicated practice))
- study phase has to be intense to get the max out of it.
- solve 4-6 problems on the topic you're struggling in increasing level of difficulty. (If you get the curated list)
    otherwise, just pick random problems on that topic and start solving.

    > **20-30 mins break** 
      Break are just time for reflection - don't go youtube, or book or email or anything, just your thoughts
