## Last day review

- Only solved two problems yesterday including daily challenge.
- Spent a long time on gas station problem. Seemed like a easy problem. Got the solution, tripped in implementaion.
  The implemented solution timed out, and I needed to look how I could optimize the solution.

[practice(contests), training(reading + dedicated problems practice)]

(3hr + 1.5 hr for forensic) 
contests = 0, score = 0 (no of contest attended + problems_solved) [ (20 contest + 10 for forensic) scale of 30]
(2hr study)
study = (1 - 3 hrs), [scale 30]
(4hr practice)
dedicated problem practice = 0/15 scale [scale of 40]

( <= less than 30min for medium, 1:30hr for hard )
daily_coding_challenge = 1/1, score = 1 ( not included in score)

total_score = (contest + study + practice)/ 100
last_day_score = (0 + 10 + 0)/100 -> 10
