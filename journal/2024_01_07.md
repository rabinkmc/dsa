## last day review

1. Attended leetcode contest was able to solve just 1 problem in the contest
2. Solved the 2nd problem just after the time limit, I really didn't force myself hard to solve this problem.
3. If you want to solve a problem in a contest, intensity really matters, just try really hard and give your max.
4. If the contest starts at time 00:00, I should be ready at 00:00 

Studied

1. Trees, basic operation on trees, set and sequence interface in trees
2. Just watched mit ocw 2020 videos on trees and avl trees
